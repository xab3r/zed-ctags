# Ctags LSP extension for Zed

Add ctags LSP server to your Zed editor for enhanced code navigation and symbol lookup.

You can enable this server by referring to it as `ctags-lsp` in your Zed configuration.

## Features

- **Go to definition**: Jump directly to symbol definitions
- **Symbol search**: Find functions, classes, and variables across your workspace
- **Code navigation**: Navigate through your codebase efficiently
- **Workspace symbol lookup**: Search for symbols across all files in your project
- **Multi-language support**: Works with any language supported by ctags
